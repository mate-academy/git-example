Variables

In Java, a variable is a container that holds data values during the execution of a program.
It has a specific data type, which determines the kind of values it can store, such as integers, floating-point numbers, or characters.
Variables must be declared with a type before they can be used, and they can be assigned and reassigned values throughout the program's lifecycle.

Here is an example:
```java
int a = 20;
```
