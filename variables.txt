Variables

In Java, a variable is a container that holds data values during the execution of a program.
It has a specific data type, which determines the kind of values it can store, such as integers, floating-point numbers, or characters.
Variables must be declared with a type before they can be used, and they can be assigned and reassigned values throughout the program's lifecycle.

Here is an example:
```java
int price = 20;
```

In this Java example, the variable `a` is declared and initialized.
The keyword `int` specifies that `a` is of type integer, meaning it can store whole numbers.
The variable `a` is then assigned the value `20`.
